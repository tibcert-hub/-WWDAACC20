</p>

<h2>WHAT:</h2>
<p>
	Throughout the day, we will be hosting the following public panels with leading experts who will cover topics related to censorship and Apple:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>CENSORSHIP IN CHINA &amp; CHINESE-CONTROLLED REGIONS:</b> A Historical and Modern Look</li>
	<li><b>FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION &amp; APPLE: </b>  The Double Standard for China, Tibet, East Turkestan, and Hong Kong </li>
	<li><b>PUBLISHING iOS APPS WHEN CENSORED</b> </li>
</ul>
<p>
	 In addition, there will be two private, advanced workshops for going more deeply into the specific mechanisms of censorship surrounding the Chinese government and Apple with regard to China’s App Store.
</p>
<h2>WHEN:</h2>
<p><b>June 22, 2020</b></p>
<p>
	The event will run from: 
</p>
<!--<p> 8 a.m. – 3 p.m. PDT / 11 a.m. – 6 p.m. EDT / 4 p.m. - 11p.m. UK / 11 p.m - 6 a.m Hong Kong / 8:30 p.m - 3:30 am IST</p> -->
<p> 9 a.m. – 4 p.m. EDT</p>
<p> 2 p.m. - 9 p.m. BST </p>
<p> 6:30 p.m - 1:30 am IST</p>
<p> 9 p.m - 4 a.m Hong Kong</p>
<h2>WHY:</h2>
<p>
	While Apple executives routinely make statements about the company’s commitment to freedom of expression and privacy as fundamental human rights, the reality for iOS users in Tibet, China, East Turkestan, and Hong Kong tells a very different story. In fact, Apple routinely removes virtual private networks (VPNs) and news apps (like the New York Times) from China’s version of the App Store. As a result, iOS users living behind the Great Firewall are denied the ability to easily avoid state surveillance or access information. This dangerous double standard for Apple’s China App Store is not only enabling a brutal crackdown, it also serves to help the government of China’s efforts to erode global norms on freedom of expression and privacy.
