<h2>WHY:</h2>
<p>
	While Apple executives routinely make statements about the company‚Äôs commitment to freedom of expression and privacy as fundamental human rights, the reality for iOS users living behind the Great Firewall tells a very different story. In fact, in the China version of the App Store, Apple censors access to information and limits the ability of users on the ground in Tibet, China, East Turkestan, and Hong Kong to avoid state surveillance. This includes removal of virtual private networks (VPNs) and news apps (like the New York Times) from China‚Äôs version of the App Store. This dangerous and unethical double standard for Apple‚Äôs China App Store is not only enabling a brutal human rights crackdown, it also serves to aid the government of China in eroding global norms on freedom of expression and privacy. Join the movement to end Apple censorship!
