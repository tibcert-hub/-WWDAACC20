<h2>WHY:</h2>
<p>
	While Apple executives routinely make statements about the companyâ€™s commitment to freedom of expression and privacy as fundamental human rights, the reality for iOS users in Tibet, China, East Turkestan, and Hong Kong tells a very different story. In fact, Apple routinely removes virtual private networks (VPNs) and news apps (like the New York Times) from Chinaâ€™s version of the App Store. As a result, iOS users living behind the Great Firewall are denied the ability to easily avoid state surveillance or access information. This dangerous double standard for Appleâ€™s China App Store is not only enabling a brutal crackdown, it also serves to help the government of Chinaâ€™s efforts to erode global norms on freedom of expression and privacy.
