</p>
<h2>WHEN:</h2>
<p><b>June 22, 2020</b></p>
<p>
	The event will run from: 
</p>
<!--<p> 8 a.m. â€“ 3 p.m. PDT / 11 a.m. â€“ 6 p.m. EDT / 4 p.m. - 11p.m. UK / 11 p.m - 6 a.m Hong Kong / 8:30 p.m - 3:30 am IST</p> -->
<p> 9 a.m. â€“ 4 p.m. EDT</p>
<p> 2 p.m. - 9 p.m. BST </p>
<p> 6:30 p.m - 1:30 am IST</p>
<p> 9 p.m - 4 a.m Hong Kong</p>
<h2>WHY:</h2>
<p>
	While Apple executives routinely make statements about the companyâ€™s commitment to freedom of expression and privacy as fundamental human rights, the reality for iOS users in Tibet, China, East Turkestan, and Hong Kong tells a very different story. In fact, Apple routinely removes virtual private networks (VPNs) and news apps (like the New York Times) from Chinaâ€™s version of the App Store. As a result, iOS users living behind the Great Firewall are denied the ability to easily avoid state surveillance or access information. This dangerous double standard for Appleâ€™s China App Store is not only enabling a brutal crackdown, it also serves to help the government of Chinaâ€™s efforts to erode global norms on freedom of expression and privacy.
