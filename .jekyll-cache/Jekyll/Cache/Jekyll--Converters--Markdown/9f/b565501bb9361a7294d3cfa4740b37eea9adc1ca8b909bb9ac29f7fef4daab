	We are ecstatic to announce that we will be hosting a pre-collaborative virtual Freedom of Expression Concert on Students for a Free Tibet’s Instagram live!

June 20th, 11 AM EST/11 PM HKT—Artists and guest speakers will be announced throughout the week leading up to the concert so be sure to follow and stay tuned!

As one of the leading tech companies, Apple has prided itself on digital security for users &amp; the idea of open access to the internet but since entering the China market, Apple has not upheld those two crucial and essential values. By the request of the CCP, Apple has removed over 1,000 virtual private networks (VPNS) as well as media apps due to supposed “violation of local regulations.” We stand against this censorship and stand with the freedom of expression.
