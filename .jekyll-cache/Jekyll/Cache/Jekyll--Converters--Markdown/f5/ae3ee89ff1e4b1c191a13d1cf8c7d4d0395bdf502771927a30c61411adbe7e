	As one of the leading tech companies, Apple has prided itself on digital security for users &amp; the idea of open access to the internet but since entering the China market, Apple has not upheld those two crucial and essential values. By the request of the CCP, Apple has removed over 1,000 virtual private networks (VPNS) as well as media apps due to supposed ‚Äúviolation of local regulations.‚Äù We stand against this censorship and stand with the freedom of expression.
